I'm going to build a web service and various client applications to help fix bad news.  I plan to openly blog about it while I build it here.  This is a side project for me.  Given the state of journalism these days, it has risen quickly on my priority list for side projects.  First thing is first, going to use a microservices architecture because I'm good with devops, so a lot of the complexity involved in microservice architectures I can reduce with automation so that the downsides are minimised while we have the potential to reap the benefits.  Some of the benefits include, increased modularity and adaptibility.

I setup a master repo which is the devops and I add any microservice to it as a git submodule.
